---

## Step 1 — Dataset Collection

The project uses a publicly available Resume Dataset containing resumes from multiple professional domains.

Examples of categories include:

- Information Technology
- Data Science
- HR
- Finance
- Sales
- Healthcare
- Engineering
- Advocate
- Banking
- Business Development
- Aviation
- Consultant
- Construction
- Fitness
- Chef
- Accountant
- and many more.

The dataset is stored as:

```text
data/raw/Resume.csv
```

---

## Step 2 — Data Cleaning

The raw resume text undergoes several preprocessing operations to improve model performance.

These include:

- Convert text to lowercase
- Remove punctuation
- Remove special characters
- Remove numbers where appropriate
- Remove extra spaces
- Normalize text

This ensures consistency across all resumes.

---

## Step 3 — Tokenization

Each resume is divided into individual words (tokens).

Example:

Before

```
Experienced Python Developer with Machine Learning skills
```

After

```
["experienced",
 "python",
 "developer",
 "machine",
 "learning",
 "skills"]
```

---

## Step 4 — Stopword Removal

Common English words that carry little semantic meaning are removed.

Examples:

- the
- is
- and
- of
- for
- with

This allows the model to focus on informative words.

---

## Step 5 — Lemmatization

Words are converted to their root form.

Examples

| Original | Lemmatized |
|-----------|------------|
| Running | Run |
| Developed | Develop |
| Engineers | Engineer |
| Skills | Skill |

This reduces vocabulary size and improves generalization.

---

## Step 6 — Feature Extraction

Machine learning models cannot process raw text directly.

Therefore, resumes are transformed into numerical vectors using:

**TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)**

The vectorizer learns the importance of words across all resumes and converts each resume into a high-dimensional numerical representation.

Saved vectorizer:

```text
models/vectorizers/tfidf_vectorizer.pkl
```

---

## Step 7 — Train-Test Split

The processed dataset is divided into:

- Training Data
- Testing Data

The training set is used to train the classifier, while the testing set evaluates model performance on unseen resumes.

---

## Step 8 — Model Training

The project uses a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier.

Why SVM?

- Effective for text classification
- Performs well on high-dimensional TF-IDF vectors
- Robust against overfitting
- Strong generalization capability
- Widely used for NLP classification tasks

Saved model:

```text
models/trained_models/svm_model.pkl
```

---

## Step 9 — Label Encoding

Professional categories are converted into numerical labels before model training.

Example:

| Category | Encoded |
|----------|----------|
| HR | 0 |
| Finance | 1 |
| IT | 2 |

Saved encoder:

```text
models/encoders/label_encoder.pkl
```

---

## Step 10 — Prediction Pipeline

When a user uploads a resume:

1. Resume is parsed
2. Text is extracted
3. Text is cleaned
4. TF-IDF vector is generated
5. SVM predicts the category
6. Category label is decoded
7. Prediction is displayed on the dashboard

This entire pipeline executes automatically in a few seconds.

---

# 📊 Model Performance

The machine learning model was evaluated using a hold-out test dataset to measure its ability to classify unseen resumes.

## Evaluation Strategy

The dataset was divided into:

| Dataset | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Training Set | Train the Support Vector Machine classifier |
| Testing Set | Evaluate prediction performance on unseen resumes |

---

## Model

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Algorithm | Support Vector Machine (SVM) |
| Feature Extraction | TF-IDF Vectorizer |
| Target Variable | Resume Category |
| Multi-Class Classification | Yes |

---

## Evaluation Metrics

The model was evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Classification Report

These metrics provide a balanced evaluation of classification performance across multiple resume categories.

---

## Model Strengths

✅ High-dimensional text classification

✅ Fast prediction speed

✅ Good generalization capability

✅ Effective on sparse TF-IDF vectors

✅ Robust performance for resume classification

---

## Current Limitations

Like most text classification systems, the model has certain limitations:

- Prediction quality depends on resume content.
- Resumes with very limited information may reduce accuracy.
- Generic resumes can overlap across multiple professional domains.
- Prediction performance depends on dataset quality and diversity.

---

## Future Improvements

Possible enhancements include:

- Hyperparameter optimization
- Cross-validation
- Larger and more diverse datasets
- Transformer-based NLP models (e.g., BERT)
- Sentence embeddings
- Semantic similarity techniques
- Deep Learning architectures

---

## Why Support Vector Machine?

Support Vector Machine was selected because it performs exceptionally well for text classification tasks.

Advantages include:

- Excellent performance on sparse data
- Effective with high-dimensional feature spaces
- Strong mathematical foundation
- Reliable generalization
- Widely adopted in Natural Language Processing applications

---

# 🔍 Resume Classification

The Resume Classification module automatically predicts the professional domain of an uploaded resume using a trained **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model.

## Classification Workflow
